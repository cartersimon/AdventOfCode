# AdventOfCode

Discovered Advent of Code recently and I'm going to use it to help me learn PowerShell. (If it goes well I may use it to learn other languages like Python, etc)
It's currently mid-November, and the 2022 challenges will be released soon, so going to try out the tasks from last year to see how far I get.
